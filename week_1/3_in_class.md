--- {.separator}

Having attempted the pre-{{ WORKSHOP/TUTORIAL/PRAC/LAB }} activities on your own, come to class prepared with questions about those activities you found difficult or couldn’t complete. Don’t be afraid to ask questions no matter how simple; chances are other students may have the same question but are too shy to speak up. Depending on the kinds of issues or concerns each week, your facilitator will either demonstrate how to develop particular solutions, encourage you to show your own attempts and consider how to improve them, or get you to work alone or in groups to develop new solutions. We expect you to be an active participant in your learning.
