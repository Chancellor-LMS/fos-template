# Markdown Basics

## Front Matter

The front matter of a markdown file is a YAML block at the top of the file containing metadata.

```yaml
---
name: "Your Page Title"
---

Your markdown content goes here.
```

Currently supported metadata fields are:

- `name`: The title of the page.

## Basic Markdown Syntax

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. For more information, see the [Markdown Guide - Basic Syntax](hthttps://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

### Headings

Headings are prefixed with `#` characters. The number of `#` characters indicates the level of the heading.

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

... and so on
```

### Emphasis

Text can be emphasised (**bold**, *italic** or ***both***) using `*` or `_` characters.

```markdown
**bold** or __bold__
*italic* or _italic_
***bold and italic*** or ___bold and italic___
```

### Lists

Unordered lists are created using `-`, `+`, or `*` characters followed by a space.

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2
```

Produces:

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2

Ordered lists are created using numbers followed by a period.

```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   1. Subitem 1
   2. Subitem 2
```

Produces:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   1. Subitem 1
   2. Subitem 2

### Links

Links are created using the following syntax:

```markdown
[Link text](URL)
```

For example:

```markdown
[Chancellor CLI GitHub](https://github.com/Chancellor-LMS/chancellor-cli)
```

Generates:

[Chancellor CLI GitHub](https://github.com/Chancellor-LMS/chancellor-cli)

### Images

Images are similar to links, but with an exclamation mark `!` at the beginning.

```markdown
![Alt text](URL)
```

For example, assuming there is an image file `welcome_page.png` in the `images` directory, relative to the current markdown file:

![Group of QUT students standing at the entrance](./images/welcome_page.png)

Is generated by:

```markdown
![Group of QUT students standing at the entrance](./images/welcome_page.png)
```

### Code Blocks

Code blocks are created by indenting the code with four spaces or using triple backticks.

````markdown
```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```
````

Produces:

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

<!-- For more advanced usage of code blocks, see the :pagelink[Code with Syntax Highlighting](./Code.md) page. -->

### Tables

Tables are created using pipes `|` to separate columns and hyphens `-` to separate the header row from the content.

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
```

Produces:

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |

<!-- For more advanced usage of tables, see the :pagelink[Tables](./Tables.md) page. -->

### Blockquotes

Blockquotes are created using `>` characters.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
>
> Blockquotes can span multiple lines.
> - They can contain lists.
> - Or code blocks.
>
> ```python
> print("Hello, world!")
> ```
```

Produces:

> This is a blockquote.
>
> Blockquotes can span multiple lines.
> - They can contain lists.
> - Or code blocks.
>
> ```python
> print("Hello, world!")
> ```

### Horizontal Rules

Horizontal rules are created using three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores.

```markdown
First section

---

Second section

***

Third section

___

Fourth section
```

Produces:

First section

---

Second section

***

Third section

___

Fourth section

# Chancellor-Flavoured Markdown

Chancellor provides additional features on top of standard markdown to enhance the content creation experience.

## Custom Blocks

Custom blocks are used to create templates for reusable content.

### Defining a Custom Block

Custom blocks are `html` files located in the `.chancellor/blocks` directory. The file name is the name of the custom block.

For example, take the supplied `note.html` custom block:

```html
<div class="note">
  <div class="note-summary">
    { title }
  </div>
  <div class="note-content">
    { content }
  </div>
</div>
```

Here, `{ title }` and `{ content }` are placeholders that will be replaced with the actual content when the custom block is used.

### Using a Custom Block

To use a custom block, use the `:::` directive followed by the block name. A pipe `|` is used to separate the block name from the title.

```markdown
::: note | This will replace the `{ title }`

This will replace the `{ content }`.

:::
```

Generates:

::: note | This will replace the `{ title }`

This will replace the `{ content }`.

:::

## Custom Links

While called **links**, they can also be used to make reusable content, similar to custom blocks.

### Defining a Custom Link

Custom links are `html` files located in the `.chancellor/inline-blocks` directory. The file name is the name of the custom link.

For example, take the supplied `filelink.html` custom link:

```html
<filelink filename="{ content }">{ title }</filelink>
```

Here, `{ title }` and `{ content }` are placeholders that will be replaced with the actual content when the custom link is used.

### Using a Custom Link

To use a custom link, use the `:filelink` directive followed by the link name.

```markdown
:linkname[title](content)
```

For example, to link to a file named `example.pdf` with the title "Example PDF":

```markdown
:filelink[Example PDF](./Adobe_Acrobat_Test.pdf)
```

Generates:

:filelink[Example PDF](./Adobe_Acrobat_Test.pdf)
