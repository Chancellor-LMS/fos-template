## 1. Docker and containers

We will begin with a very quick introduction and we then lead into an overview of Docker and how it fits into the landscape.

## 2. Virtualisation

Our more detailed coverage of virtualisation - the why and the how - is here split into a number of separate videos. 

First we explore virtualisation.

Some aspects of this are more important than others. You need to understand the basics, but the Deep Dive can be left for the enthusiasts. And then we look more closely at hardware virtualisation. The goal really is that you understand the VMs that make up the bulk of IaaS provision, and that you know enough to understand why CaaS or Container as a Service is so important.

Finally, here, we take a deeper dive into hardware and hardware assisted virtualisation, which is probably more for the enthusiasts and can be skipped if you get short of time.

Here we look at Docker in more detail through two videos. In the first one, we look at Docker, the Docker lifecycle and its basic commands:

Later, we rather forensically look over a Dockerfile and show you how to create a Docker image and to then run it as a Docker container:

## 3. CaaS Offerings

Our final video for the week is a brief introduction to some more sophisticated container offerings, with Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and the various CaaS services from the majors.
