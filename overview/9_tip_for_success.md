# Connect and participate

- Keep up with the work by completing the preparation for class activities each week and make a list of questions you have and bring them to your scheduled workshop.

- Attend all of your in-person or online synchronous workshops for ‘real time’ interaction and learning. If you cannot attend your regular workshop, you may be able to attend another class that week. Details of all workshops are available on the :pagelink[Contact your Teaching Team](./2_contact.md) page.

- Arrive a few minutes early or stay a few minutes late to have casual conversations with your tutors and peers before or after workshops.

- Check-in regularly on Canvas to review unit announcements and to be aware of any updates to learning material.

- Embrace online communication by keeping in touch with your peers via your unit communication channel, which may include contributing and posting on community forums.

- Consider forming your own study group and have either in-person or online meet-ups via Zoom for both learning related and social interactions. ‘Real time’ connection and communication helps to keep you engaged, motivated and less isolated particularly for those who are learning at a distance.

- Ensure you familiarise yourself with the consultation times of teaching staff.

- If you have any concerns about your learning, are feeling anxious or stressed, speaking to someone could help to alleviate any concerns you might have. The **Study support** and **Personal support** links on the left-hand menu provides you with a list of free support available to QUT students.

Good luck!
