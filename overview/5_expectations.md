We've found that learning works best when there are clear expectations of learners and academic staff. This is what we think is most important:

| We expect you to ... || You can expect us to... ||
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Be Professional**. To act within the [QUT Student Code of Conduct](https://www.mopp.qut.edu.au/E/E_02_01.jsp) and {{ INSERT PROFESSIONAL CODE OF CONDUCT HERE }}. | 1 | Make sure learning materials are available on time so you can complete preparation activities and achieve the unit learning outcomes. |
| 2 | Complete 'Preparation for class' activities before scheduled classes, and attend, participate and engage in class learning. | 2 | Provide timely, transparent and meaningful feedback on your learning progress via individual feedback on assessment submissions and summary feedback to the entire class. |
| 3 | Check your QUT email, Canvas announcements and other communication channels daily. | 3 | Treat all students fairly and equitably. |
| 4 | Be responsible for your learning, by being organised, asking questions, thinking critically and seeing help early. | 4 | Be available at pre-determined times or at drop-in sessions. |
