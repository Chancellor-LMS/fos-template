Being able to give effective feedback is an important employability skill. Throughout your studies you will have the opportunity to provide feedback to peers and also provide feedback on your learning experience to your unit coordinators and tutors. Regardless of who you are providing feedback to, the aim is always to encourage and challenge people to further improve. Here are some tips to help you to give effective feedback:

1. **Focus on the behaviour not the person**. When giving feedback, it is important to remember that a 'real' person with feelings and emotions will be receiving your feedback, therefore it is important to focus on observable behaviours and not on the person. People get very defensive if they view their feedback as a personal criticism.
2. **Prioritise your feedback.** Identify the most important issues and address them. Providing too much feedback can overwhelm the receiver and significantly reduce the effectiveness of your message and the ability of the receiver to take action based on the feedback received.
3. **Be specific.** Try to use examples to illustrate your feedback statements. General and vague comments are not useful to the person receiving the feedback.
4. **Be realistic.** Focus on what can be changed. It is useless and frustrating to receive feedback on something over which you have no control.
5. **Give balanced feedback.** For your unit evaluations, identify positive and negative aspects, as well as actions that could be taken to improve.
6. **Provide your opinion.** Feedback should be based on what you have observed with your own two eyes and not based on hearsay or what you think might be the opinions of others. Use the word 'I' when providing feedback.
